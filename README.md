# FastTask

In an increasingly competitive world, FastTask is envisioned to take advantage of this competition by allowing any user to post a job similarly to a competition that upon first valid completion will award the creator of the response the prize currency. This promotes quick work and responses for users in need of urgent help.

# WIP

This current implementation is meant to be an MVP of the project.
In the future, there will be an alternate mode where the original poster's chosen best response after a set time will be awarded the prize currency.

# Requirements

MongoDB
